Finding related amenity tags on the OpenStreetMap

Source files are UTF-8 encoded. The code is written using dplyr 0.4.2. It
will probably not work with earlier versions. Images were compiled using
GraphViz 2.38.0.

Compiling the analysis requires some manual steps listed below:

- Ensure that the images referenced with markdown-code from the .Rmd file
  exist in the `./images/`-directory. These can be dummy images. They will
  later be replaced.

- Compile the R markdown file (for example, using R Studio). By default,
  the extracted OSM data is read from the directory
    `~/osm-data/amenities-output-history-150810/`.

- Run `./scripts/compile_images`. This will use GraphViz to convert the
  .gv files into png and svg files in the `./images/`-directory.

- Crop/manipulate these png-image in-place to get the images shown in
  the analysis. Then run `./scripts/move_images`. This will rename the cropped
  images to end with `-crop.png`.

- Rerun `./scripts/compile_images` to generate the full images.

- (Recompile the R markdown file to include the excerpts. Only needed for
  html output.)

- Run `file ./images/*.png` to get the dimensions of the cropped images, and
  edit the css header in `./scripts/post-header` to get the same scaling factor
  for all image excerpts shown in the analysis.

- Run `./scripts/make_post` to convert the markdown output .md-file and the images
  into a Jekyll post. Edit the script to set the output directory.
